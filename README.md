# CalenDaily
Application: Color-coordinated daily planner 
<br></br>

## Description
This application provides an end-user with the ability to add tasks to a daily schedule. The user can save each task by the hour and when the page is reloaded, the tasks stored in local storage are displayed on the application.

### Usage
An application for organizing an end-user's day tasks for standard business hours of 9 AM - 5 PM.

### Tasks Completed 
```
HTML & CSS:
* Added additional HTML elements and edited starter code. 
* Added and revised some CSS selectors.

JavaScript:
* Displayed the current day at the top of the calendar.
* Presented time blocks for standard business hours for the user to utilize.
* Color-coded each time block to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
* Provided capability for the user to click on time blocks and enter an event.
* Activated event listeners to each time block save buttons to save in local storage.
* Structured order of code so when the page is refreshed in the code or manually by the end user, the saved events persist on the application within their designated time block.
